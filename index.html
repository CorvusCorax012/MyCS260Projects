      <h3>About:</h3>
      <p>My name is Grayson Schmalz, I am a student at Brigham Young University and I am studying Computer Science.<br>

      I want to learn all sorts of technology so I can solve problems and help other people. In particular, I want to apply these technologies to the medical field.

      <h3>Projects:</h3>
      <p>I still have a <em>TON to learn</em> about a lot, but there are some things that I am trying to learn and I will tell you about a few of them!</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Learning Unity:</strong> my cousin and I are working on making a game called MechMazeMadness. A game that you play as a robot trying to solve a 3D maze.</li>
        <li><strong>Arduino:</strong> I got an arduino board so I am going to enjoy learning more about programming and working with hardware.</li>
        <li><strong>Drone Programming:</strong> I also got a Tello drone and I am going to program it using Python and hopefully use machine learning to get some simple object recognition working on it!</li>
